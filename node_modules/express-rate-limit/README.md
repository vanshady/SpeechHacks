Basic rate-limiting middleware for Express. Use to limit repeated requests to public endpoints such as account creation and password reset.

Note: this module does not share state with other processes/servers.
If you need a more robust solution, I recommend checking out the excellent [strict-rate-limiter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/strict-rate-limiter)


## Install

```sh
$ npm install --save express-rate-limit
```

## Configuration

* **windowMs**: milliseconds - how long to keep records of requests in memory. Defaults to `60000` (1 minute).
* **delayAfter**: max number of connections during `windowMs` before starting to delay responses. Defaults to `1`. Set to `0` to disable delaying.  
* **delayMs**: milliseconds - how long to delay the response, multiplied by (number of recent hits - `delayAfter`).  Defaults to `1000` (1 second). Set to `0` to disable delaying.
* **max**: max number of connections during `windowMs` milliseconds before sending a 429 response. Defaults to `5`. Set to `0` to disable.
* **message**: Error message returned when `max` is exceeded. Defaults to `'Too many requests, please try again later.'`
* **statusCode**: HTTP status code returned when `max` is exceeded. Defaults to `429`.

The `delayAfter` and `delayMs` options were written for human-facing pages such as login and password reset forms. 
For public APIs, setting these to `0` (disabled) and relying on only `windowMs` and `max` for rate-limiting usually makes the most sense.

## Usage

For an API-only server where the rate-limiter should be applied to all requests:

```js
var rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');

app.enable('trust proxy'); // only if you're behind a reverse proxy (Heroku, Bluemix, AWS if you use an ELB, custom Nginx setup, etc)

// default options shown below
var limiter = rateLimit({/* config */});

//  apply this globally
app.use(limiter);
```

For a "regular" web server (e.g. anything that uses `express.static()`), where the rate-limiter should only apply to certain requests:

```js
var rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');

app.enable('trust proxy'); // only if you're behind a reverse proxy (Heroku, Bluemix, AWS if you use an ELB, custom Nginx setup, etc)

var limiter = rateLimit({/* config */});

// apply to all requests that begin with /api/
app.use('/api/', limiter);

// apply to an individual endpoint
app.post('/create-account', limiter, function(req, res) {
   // ...
}

// optionally set up an endpoint to reset the rate limit for an IP
var limiter2 = rateLimit({/* altConfig */);  // we can't use the same rateLimit instance on the reset endpoint, but we probably do want it limited.
app.post('/reset-rate-limit', limiter2, function(req, res) {
   // validate that requester has filled out a captcha properly or whatever and then...
  limiter.resetIp(req.ip);
  // ...
} 
```

## Instance API

* **resetIp(ip)**: Resets the rate limiting for a given ip.

## v2 changes

v2 uses a less precise but less resource intensive method of tracking hits from a given IP. v2 also adds the `limiter.resetIp()` API and removes the `global: true` option.
